### Instructions
See the .pdf on Learning Suite for the instructions.

### 1. When you're done: Push your code to GitHub
Before anything else, make sure that your file with your code is saved. You can go to File > Save All from the little menu in the top left of VS Code. If Save All is grayed out, that means all your files are already saved.

To turn in your code by pushing it to GitHub, copy the command below:
```
git add -A && git commit -m "exam submission" && git push
```
- On Mac, highlight the command with your mouse, then press cmd + c to copy

- Then in the terminal (not your python code) press cmd + v to paste in the command 
    - If you see a popup, click "Allow"
- Then press enter/return in the Terminal


### 2. When you're done: Copy and paste your code to Learning Suite
Click somewhere in your python code, then press cmd + a to select everything, then cmd + c to copy it, then go to Learning Suite and press cmd + v to paste it.
